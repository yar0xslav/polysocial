Hey there, please don't be too strict when reading this, its my first readme doc :)

This is a public project to show the code and logics behind Polysocial (polysocial.xyz) â€“ a social prediction game currently available for Farcaster users.

Currently there is only one Python script called leaderboard_copy.py available in the project's folder. Its main function is to pull the data from postgres replicator, calculate bets made by players according to game rules and organize it in a leaderboard table.

Please feel free to reach out via Warpcast or Telegram DMs (@yar0x) if you have any questions or suggestions :)
